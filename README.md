 **Char–Chitti (चार चिठ्ठी)**

Here’s a detailed breakdown of how it works:

---

## 🎴 Meaning of the Name

* **Char (चार)** = Four
* **Chitti (चिठ्ठी)** = Small slip or chit

So *Char–Chitti* literally means **“Four Slips.”**

---

## 🐘 Basic Concept

Each player tries to collect **four identical chits** (same animal or same title).
The first person to do so wins.

It is similar in structure to simple passing card games, but uses chits instead of playing cards.

---

## 🧩 Materials Required

* Small paper chits
* Pen/marker
* A bowl or container (optional)

---

## 📝 Preparation

1. Choose **animal names** (or any category like fruits, birds, cartoon characters, etc.).
2. For each animal, write its name on **4 separate chits**.

Example (for 4 players):

* Lion ×4
* Tiger ×4
* Elephant ×4
* Monkey ×4

Total = 16 chits

3. Shuffle all chits thoroughly.
4. Distribute **4 random chits to each player**.

---

## 🎮 How to Play

### Step 1: Game Begins

* All players sit in a circle.
* Each player secretly checks their 4 chits.

### Step 2: Passing Phase (Core Mechanic)

* At the same time, each player selects **one chit** they don’t need.
* Everyone passes that chit to the **player on their right (clockwise)**.
* This continues continuously and quickly.

⚡ Important: No stopping between passes — the flow should be smooth and fast.

---

## 🏆 Winning Condition

* If any player collects **4 identical chits** (for example, 4 Lions),

* They immediately shout something like:

  * “Char!”
  * Or the animal name
  * Or pre-decided code word

* That player wins the round.

---

## 🎯 Strategy Element

Even though it seems random, strategy is involved:

* Observe what others are holding.
* Try to predict what others are collecting.
* Quickly discard useless chits.
* Maintain speed to avoid giving advantage to others.

Sometimes players bluff by pretending to collect something else.

---

## 👥 Number of Players

* Minimum: 3
* Ideal: 4–8 players
* Can scale up by adding more animal sets.

---

## 🔄 Variations

### 1️⃣ Silent Version

No talking allowed during passing.

### 2️⃣ Action Version

Instead of shouting, the winner performs an action (clap 4 times, tap table, etc.).

### 3️⃣ Punishment Version

Last person to react after winner gets a small fun task.
